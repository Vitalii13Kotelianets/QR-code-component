# QR-code-component
This repository contains a customizable QR code component for web and mobile applications, with clear documentation and easy integration. 


The HTML code is structured with the basic tags, including the head and body sections, and includes links to external files, such as the font and style sheets. The body of the code contains a container div, which holds the QR code image, along with two divs for displaying text.

The CSS code defines the styling for the various elements in the HTML, including the font family, background color, and positioning of the container div. The styling for the QR code image and the text is also defined, with different properties specified for different screen sizes, using media queries.
